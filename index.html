                    I took a poster board that help me maintain my enthusiasm and focus.A goal board also makes it
                    easier to
                    visualize how I'll feel once is complete. In effect, it gets my subconscious mind “on board” with my
                    plan to
                    reach my goal.I want my entire psyche working to achieve my goal.It takes hard work and consistent
                    effort to
                    achieve major goals. I can maintain my passion and motivation to make my dreams come true with these
                    simple,
                    focus-maintaining strategies.

                    "Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out.”
                    The most important goal is to find my life purpose and to never give up, despite whatever
                    difficulties or
                    seemingly impossible odds stand in my way."In some ways, programming is like painting. You start
                    with a blank canvas and certain basic raw materials. You use a combination of science, art, and
                    craft to determine what to do with them."</p>
